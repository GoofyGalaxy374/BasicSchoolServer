# BasicSchoolServer
This is a basic node and express server that I made for school purposes.
## Instructions
After cloning the repo on your computer, open the terminal in the folder and run npm install. \
After the installation is done, run the following command - node MockServer.js \
In case that the port you're running the server on is taken, you can change the port from the MockServer.js file.
